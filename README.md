Final project for the 2025-1 Modeling and Simulation class, designed and developed at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México(UNAM), at the Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores (ENES Morelia). This project is carried out by students of the Bachelor's Degree in Technologies for Information in the Sciences.
## Introduction
### Project Description
This project aims to simulate the behavior of hydrogen atoms when subjected to heat or cold, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods. The simulation tracks the trajectory of the atoms under controlled temperature conditions, observing how they move over time.
## Particular Objetives

Understanding behavior at the atomic level:

* Thermal motion: When heat or cold is applied, atoms vibrate and move in specific ways. Simulation allows you to visualize and quantify these motions.
* Interactions: You can study how atoms interact with each other and how these interactions are affected by temperature.
* Macroscopic properties: From behavior at the atomic level, you can infer macroscopic properties such as thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and thermal expansion.
