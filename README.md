## Introduction

This project aims to simulate the behavior of hydrogen atoms when subjected to heat or cold, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods. To achieve accurate simulation, the transmission model will be initialized using Maxwell's distribution to correctly describe the electromagnetic interactions influencing the dynamics of atoms at the microscopic level. Additionally, the simulation environment will be configured in ECLive, where a gas model will be employed to efficiently represent thermal conditions.

The simulation will track the trajectory of the atoms under controlled temperature conditions, observing how they move and how interactions between them vary depending on temperature changes. This study will not only visualize atomic-level thermal motions but also infer relevant macroscopic properties from the observed behavior.
## Justification
The basic idea of the N-body problem came in 1687 with Isaac Newton's work Principia. The capability of describing the interaction between different particles through Newton's second law of motion with equations brought a lot of attention and investigation to reach the solution of the problem. Later, the limitations of this problem were found by Henry Poincaré: something known as the non-integrability principle. Which would occur whenever there were three or more bodies in the problem.

Due to these issues, there aren't analytical solutions to the N-Body problem. Leading us to the use of numerical methods that are capable of tracking and moving the position of each particle in the system given some initial data. This results in numerical solutions whose accuracy tends to have really satisfactory results for long periods of time. Allowing us to give approximate solution to lots of problems of this nature.
## General Objective
