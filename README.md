## Hydrogen Atoms Simulator: Behavior Under Heat and Cold

### Project Description
This project aims to simulate the behavior of hydrogen atoms when subjected to heat or cold, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods. The simulation tracks the trajectory of the atoms under controlled temperature conditions, observing how they move over time.
